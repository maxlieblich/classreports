# classreports

This is a collection of `R` functions and some `knitr` documents that allow one to make basic reports on class exam performance. At the moment, this includes things like reporting mean, median, and standard deviation, making box plots of per-question performance, and looking at correlations between questions and exams.

The basis for this is a grading "scheme" wherein exam grades are recorded using strings: each character represents the score on a single question. (This is only viable -- barring the use of large character sets! -- if any given question is worth at most 35 points, which will only be violated when a complete idiot has written the test.)

Barebones! Please feel free to make this better.
